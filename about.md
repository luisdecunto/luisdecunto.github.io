## Hi, I'm Luis!

I'm a **Mechanical Engineer** with a strong passion for **computational modeling, numerical methods, and machine learning**. Currently working as a Research Assistant at **Aarhus University**, I specialize in developing sophisticated simulations and leveraging ML to solve complex engineering problems.

### What I Do

My work sits at the intersection of **mechanical engineering**, **numerical simulations**, and **data science**. I'm passionate about:

- **Finite Element Modeling (FEM)** - Developing advanced simulations for thermoforming, thin shell mechanics, and material behavior
- **Machine Learning & Surrogate Modeling** - Building ML models to predict physical phenomena and accelerate engineering workflows
- **Mathematical Modeling** - Creating analytical and numerical models for complex systems (geometrical metamaterials, kirigami structures)
- **Optimization** - Applying nonlinear optimization and ML techniques to improve designs and processes
- **Scientific Computing** - Expert in Python, MATLAB, and computational tools (ABAQUS, ANSYS, COMSOL)

### My Journey

**Currently:** Research Assistant at **Aarhus University** (2021 - Present)
- Working on the **KurvedWind Project**: Developed FEM simulations of thermoforming processes and built ML-based surrogate models for spring-back prediction
- **Elasto Capillary Kirigami Project**: Mathematical modeling of geometrical metamaterials, conducting experiments, and analyzing complex material behavior

**Previously:**
- Research in **Mechanical Metamaterials and Soft Matter** (MMSM group) - Numerical simulations with ABAQUS, parallel computing with Python
- **Nuclear industry** experience at CONUAR FAE (Argentina) - FEM simulations of tube manufacturing processes
- **Teaching Assistant** - Mechanical Vibrations, Continuum Mechanics, Physics

**Education:**
- **M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering** - Aarhus University (2019-2021)
  - Thesis: "Numerical Study of Stress Localization in Thin Shells"
- **Mechanical Engineer** - Instituto Tecnológico de Buenos Aires, ITBA (2011-2018)
  - Final Project: "Numerical Implementation of a Hydraulic Fracturing model using XFEM"

### Technical Expertise

**Programming & Tools:**
- **Languages:** Python, MATLAB
- **FEM/CFD Software:** ABAQUS, ANSYS, COMSOL, Siemens NX, CATIA
- **ML/Data Science:** Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas
- **Numerical Methods:** Finite Element Method, optimization algorithms, surrogate modeling

**Core Competencies:**
- Mathematical Modeling & Numerical Simulations
