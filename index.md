# Luis De Cunto

**Mechanical Engineer | M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering**

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a mechanical engineer specializing in **computational modeling** and **machine learning**, currently working as a Research Assistant at Aarhus University.

## What I Do

I work at the intersection of mechanical engineering, numerical simulations, and data science:

- **Finite Element Modeling (FEM)** - Advanced simulations for complex engineering problems
- **Machine Learning & Surrogate Modeling** - Building ML models to predict physical phenomena
- **Mathematical Modeling** - Creating analytical and numerical models for complex systems
- **Optimization** - Applying ML techniques to improve designs and processes

## Current Work

Currently at **Aarhus University** (2021 - Present):
- **KurvedWind Project**: FEM simulations + ML surrogate models for spring-back prediction (1000x speedup!)
- **Elasto Capillary Kirigami**: Mathematical modeling of geometrical metamaterials

## Education

- **M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering** - Aarhus University (2019-2021)
- **Mechanical Engineer** - Instituto Tecnológico de Buenos Aires, ITBA (2011-2018)

## Technical Skills

**Programming:** Python, MATLAB
**FEM/CFD:** ABAQUS, ANSYS, COMSOL, Siemens NX
**ML/Data Science:** Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas
