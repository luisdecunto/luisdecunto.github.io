## Project Overview

The **Elasto Capillary Kirigami Project** explores the fascinating world of **geometrical metamaterials** through mathematical modeling, experimental design, and data analysis. This research investigates how cutting patterns (kirigami) combined with surface tension create complex mechanical behaviors.

## What is Kirigami?

Kirigami (切り紙) is the Japanese art of paper cutting. In materials science, kirigami patterns enable:
- **Programmable mechanical properties** through cut geometry
- **Shape morphing** capabilities
- **Energy absorption** and shock resistance
- **Tunable stiffness** without changing material

When combined with capillary forces (surface tension), these structures exhibit rich and unexpected mechanical behaviors.

## Research Objectives

1. Develop **mathematical models** to predict kirigami metamaterial behavior
2. Design and fabricate **experimental specimens** with various cut patterns
3. Conduct **mechanical testing** to validate theoretical predictions
4. Analyze complex **deformation modes** and failure mechanisms
